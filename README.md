# WoW-Addons
Repo for WoW addons that I have developed.


* [InterruptReminder](InterruptReminder) - Highlight the class' interrupt abilities when the target is casting or channeling a spell that can
be interrupted. Useful for newer players learning their rotation, or those like me, who simply forget to cast their
interrupts.
* [HumorousDeath](HumorousDeath) - Play 43 (so far) unique funny sound files when the player character dies to provide
some humor to the tragedy that occurred. Sound file plays only once and stops playing when the player character is
revived by any means.
* [ThreatTrack](https://github.com/AgentRG/WoW-Addons/tree/main/ThreatTrack) - Keep track of all threat percentages through a display of a table of all units currently in-combat with the player, as
in, the unit in question is aware of the player's existence and considers him a threat to some degree.
