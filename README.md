# WoW-Addons
Repo for WoW addons that I have developed.


* [Interrupt Reminder](InterruptReminder) - Highlight the class' interrupt abilities when the target is casting or channeling a spell that can
be interrupted. Useful for newer players learning their rotation, or those like me, who simply forget to cast their
interrupts.
* [Humorous Death](HumorousDeath) - Play 43 (so far) unique funny sound files when the player character dies to provide
some humor to the tragedy that occurred. Sound file plays only once and stops playing when the player character is
revived by any means.
* [Threat Track](https://github.com/AgentRG/WoW-Addons/tree/main/ThreatTrack) - Keep track of all threat percentages through a display of a table of all units currently in-combat with the player, as
in, the unit in question is aware of the player's existence and considers him a threat to some degree.
* [Heart Attack](https://github.com/AgentRG/WoW-Addons/tree/main/HeartAttack) - Game within a game. Every 10 minutes, role for a chance to get a virtual heart attack. Actual gameplay of WoW not impacted. 
With every action taken by the player, the chance of getting a heart attack increases every so slightly, but ever so low.
* [Talking Head - Shut!](https://github.com/AgentRG/WoW-Addons/tree/main/TalkingHeadShut) - An addon that automatically closes the talking head popups that convey a plot story during quests, dungeons and raids. Useful when you've heard the same story a thounsad times or when it's blocking your view.
* [LibFramePool-1.0](https://github.com/AgentRG/WoW-Addons/tree/main/LibFramePool-1.0) - Creates a table containing n amount of frames of the same type with optional argument to predefine the frames. Since a table is being returned on creation, the created variable can be looped using a loop of your choice to make changes to the frames, or individual frames called upon based on their index position.
