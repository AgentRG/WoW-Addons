# Interrupt Reminder

Highlight the class' interrupt abilities when the target is casting or channeling a spell that can
be interrupted. Useful for newer players learning their rotation, or those like me, who simply forget to cast their
interrupts.

## Features
* Real-time tracking of a target's spell casting and providing World of Warcraft's actionbar glow effect to spells
who's primarily function is to cause an interrupt. The spell being tracked are as followed:
  * Death Knight: Mind Freeze, Asphyxiate, Strangulate, Death Grip
  * Demon Hunter: Disrupt 
  * Druid: Skull Bash, Solar Beam 
  * Evoker: Quell 
  * Hunter: Counter Shot, 'Muzzle 
  * Mage: Counterspell 
  * Monk: Spear Hand Strike 
  * Paladin: Rebuke, Avenger's Shield 
  * Priest: Silence 
  * Rogue: Kick 
  * Shaman: Wind Shear 
  * Warlock: Spell Lock, Optical Blast, Axe Toss 
  * Warrior: Pummel

* Optional opt-in into additional tracking of any spell capable of applying a Crowd Control affect (also interrupting)
by going to the options menu and enabling "Enable Advanced Spell Selection".
  * Smart algorithm runs in the background with passing accuracy do determine whether the target of the spell is susceptible to crowd control spells.
